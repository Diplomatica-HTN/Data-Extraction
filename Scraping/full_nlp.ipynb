      "Recent rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death among unvaccinated Albertans have been at least eight times higher — and as much as 60 times higher — compared to the fully vaccinated population, depending on which age range you look at.That's according to a new CBC News analysis of data published by the provincial government.Data experts with Alberta Health reviewed the analysis and confirmed the methodology as an effective way to compare severe outcomes relative to both vaccination status and age — while also accounting for the population sizes of each group.These types of comparisons can be tricky, because the risk of severe outcomes increases with age, but so too does the rate of vaccination. As such, population-wide comparisons don't tell the full story.For example, it's often reported that unvaccinated Albertans make up just 32 per cent of the population but a whopping 74 per cent of the COVID-19 patients in hospital. But this actually under-represents the risk for unvaccinated adults, because a huge proportion of the unvaccinated population is made up of children who are both ineligible for the vaccine and unlikely to end up in hospital.Breaking the data down by age helps to better understand how things compare among the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated.\"Age, in particular, really controls a few outcomes here in the province,\" said Craig Jenne, a professor in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the University of Calgary.Jenne also reviewed the data analysis and says it illustrates how effective vaccination against COVID-19 has been in Alberta, so far.\"We see that there's huge protection offered by vaccines, and that's something I think gets missed in the daily updates when we simply see numbers or the percentage of people in hospital,\" he said.Here's how it breaks down.It's well known by now that older people are far more likely to end up in hospital than younger people, but looking at the data by both age and vaccination status reveals some stark comparisons.For instance, it shows that unvaccinated Albertans in their 30s have been ending up in hospital with COVID-19 at roughly the same rate as fully vaccinated Albertans over the age of 80.From mid-May to mid-September, 400 unvaccinated people in their 30s were admitted to hospital with COVID-19.That works out to a rate of about 146 hospitalizations per 100,000 unvaccinated 30-somethings over that four-month span.And that's almost identical to the rate of hospitalization among fully vaccinated Albertans aged 80 and up.Meanwhile, among unvaccinated Albertans 80 and over, the rate was nine times higher — 1,271 hospitalizations per 100,000.And the differences in ICU admissions were even starker.Just seven fully vaccinated Albertans in their 50s have been admitted to an intensive care unit with COVID-19 since mid-May.That compares to 181 unvaccinated people of the same age — despite the fact that there are far fewer of them.Fully vaccinated 50-somethings were admitted to ICU at a rate of less than 3 per 100,000.The rate among the unvaccinated, by comparison, was 139 per 100,000.It was a similar story among unvaccinated Albertans in their 60s and 70s, who were admitted to ICU at rates about 60 times higher than their fully vaccinated counterparts.There were major differences among younger Albertans, as well.Not a single fully vaccinated person under the age of 40 was admitted to ICU over the past four months.That compares to 129 people under the age of 40 who were eligible for the vaccine but didn't get a shot.One person in their 30s who was partially immunized, with a single dose of vaccine, did wind up in ICU during that time.Similar with ICU admissions, there was not a single death among fully vaccinated Albertans under the age of 40 in the past four months.That compares to seven deaths among unvaccinated people of the same age.When it comes to the most vulnerable age group — those 80 and over — there were 61 deaths among the unvaccinated, who represent a tiny proportion of the total population in that age range.That translates to a rate of about 393 per 100,000.The rate among fully vaccinated Albertans aged 80-plus, meanwhile, was 42 per 100,000.For Jenne, the infectious-disease expert with the University of Calgary, the implications of the data are clear.\"Vaccines are dramatically reducing loss of life, hospitalization and intensive-care-unit admissions across the province,\" he said.This can be seen, he said, by directly comparing the rates of hospitalization, ICU admission and death among the fully vaccinated and the unvaccinated in each age range.Those numbers are set out in the table below.As the number of COVID-19 patients in ICU set another new high on Thursday, the Alberta government reached out to Ontario to ask for help, in case Alberta completely runs out of capacity in the near future and needs to fly patients out of province for intensive care.\"I cannot stress enough how serious the situation is in our hospitals,\" said Dr. Verna Yiu, president and CEO of Alberta Health Services.\"I also cannot stress enough that we need your help. Please get immunized. ... The vaccine is safe — and effective.\"Notes about the data and methodology:Alberta Health publishes two different sets of data that were used for this analysis.The first is the total number of people who have been hospitalized, admitted to ICU or died over the past 120 days, broken down by their age range and vaccination status.The second is the number of people in each age range who are fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated or unvaccinated. For the purposes of the analysis, the size of the fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated population in each age range was calculated by taking an average of daily data over the past 120 days.These population sizes were then used to calculate the rates of hospitalization, ICU admission and death per 100,000 fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated people in each age range. This method doesn't account exactly for the individual vaccination status of every person who was hospitalized, admitted to ICU or died of COVID-19, but officials with Alberta Health said \"as an overall method this approach does make sense\" as a means of making better comparisons between each of these sub-groups at an aggregate level.One other caveat Alberta Health noted is that the data on hospitalization, ICU admission and death by vaccination status over the past 120 days defines a \"fully vaccinated\" person as someone who had their second dose at least two weeks earlier, and a \"partially vaccinated\" person as someone who had their first dose at least two weeks earlier. This differs from the vaccine-uptake data, in which the dates are \"based strictly on receiving a dose.\"Data JournalistRobson Fletcher's work for CBC Calgary focuses on data, analysis and investigative journalism.

      "\tHealth Minister Christine Elliott has confirmed that Ontario will provide support to Alberta as the province deals with an influx of COVID-19 patients in its intensive care units.\n",
      "\tThe province has been experiencing an exponential growth in cases for weeks now, and on Wednesday, Premier Jason Kenney declared a provincewide state of emergency as he warned that Alberta could run out of staffed intensive care beds within 10 days.\n",
      "\tSpeaking with reporters during a news conference on Friday, Elliott said that Ontario is committed to helping Alberta even as the province deals with its own fourth wave of the pandemic.\n",
      "\tShe said that it is too early to say precisely what form that help will take but hinted that “intensive care will be at the top of the list.”\n",
      "\t“This is a truly cross Canadian effort. There was a time when Ontario needed some help as well and other provinces helped us,” she said. “We will certainly do the same to help Alberta and our officials are having conversations right now about exactly what they needed and we will be there to support them.”\n",
      "\tDuring the third wave of the pandemic in the spring, a team of healthcare workers from Newfound and Labrador travelled to Ontario to help out at some of the province’s most overburdened hospitals for weeks on end.\n",
      "\tMembers of the Canadian Forces were also deployed in the GTA, predominantly to help with the operation of a field hospital set up outside Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.\n",
      "\tNews that Ontario will provide support to Alberta comes after officials in British Columbia confirmed that they would be unable to assist due to the challenges in their own province as a result of the fourth wave.\n",
      "\tThe situation in Ontario, however, does appear to be more under control than in many of the western provinces, at least for now.\n",
      "\tOn Friday morning, the Ministry of Health reported 795 new cases of COVID-19 today as its seven-day rolling average declined for the second week in a row.\n",
      "\tThat is down from the 848 new cases identified at this time last week.\n",
      "\tThe rolling seven-day average now stands at 724 and appears to be slowly declining after months of exponential growth. It stood at 728.5 last Friday and 731.7 two weeks ago.\n",
      "\tIt remains largely unclear what effect the reopening of schools could have on transmission in the weeks to come.\n",
      "On Friday, Ontario’s publicly funded school boards reported another 121 school-related cases. That accounts for about 15 per cent of Ontario’s overall caseload, up from 12 per cent on Thursday.\n",
      "\tHospitalizations also continue to slowly increase after plummeting over the summer.\n",
      "\tAccording to the latest Critical Care Services Ontario report, there are 192 adults with COVID-19 in intensive care units after an additional 13 admissions over the last 24 hours. There are also two pediatric cases being treated in intensive care, including one in Toronto.\n",
      "\tHowever, there were still hundreds of available beds in ICU units on Thursday night, suggesting that there could be capacity in the system to accept patients from Alberta should officials decide to go that route.\n",
      "\t“I think we currently have capacity,” infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch told CP24 on Friday morning. “We really have to help our brothers and our sisters out across the county. Remember not too long ago we were in a very similar situation where we exceeded our capacity and asked for help from outside provinces and received that help. If we can provide healthcare providers or take patients, I think we should be jumping in with both feet. This is just what we do as Canadians.”\n",
      "Testing volumes remain high following reopening of schools\n",
      "\tThe latest cases reported on Friday came on nearly 34,000 individual tests, as the province continues to deal with higher volumes that have coincided with the reopening of schools.\n",
      "\tThe overall positivity rate was 2.4 per cent.\n",
      "\tThat is down from last week when positivity rates above three per cent were regularly being reported, albeit on a lower volume of tests.\n",
      "\tOf the latest cases, 166 were in Toronto, 77 were in Peel Region, 71 were in York Region, 60 were in Durham Region, 33 were in Hamilton and 10 were in Halton Region.\n",
      "\tFor Durham Region, it is the highest number of new cases reported in any single 24-hour period since early June.\n",
      "\tThe Ontario Science Table estimates that more than 99 per cent of all new cases being discovered in the province involve the more transmissible Delta variant.An ICU health-care worker shown inside a negative pressure room cares for a COVID-19 patient on a ventilator at the Humber River Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto on Wednesday, December 9, 2020.

Police were called and eventually dispersed them.Video of that incident shows a peaceful scene during rainy weather, with those gathered saying they wanted answers to their questions on children’s consent to get vaccinated.According to the province, those 13 and older “are given the opportunity to consent to immunization themselves.”The protesters served the board office and three principals with a vaccine notice of liability, the spokesperson said.Later on Friday, the school district sent a letter to parents to say that as of Monday, all schools will be placed on lockdown. Outside doors will be locked, and those wishing to enter will have to phone ahead for an appointment.“This means that students will not be able to leave and enter the building,” the letter said.“If at some point you are needing to get into your child’s school, please contact the office and the administration team will be able to assist you.”\n",

Full Disclaimer The Globe and Mail contacted all Conservative candidates who had publicly listed e-mail addresses and asked the party for the vaccination status of the candidates who did not have public e-mail addresses. Kayle Neis/The Canadian PressThe vast majority of Conservative candidates are not disclosing their vaccination status, even as their party leader has championed vaccinations as key to getting through the pandemic.Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole has said if his party wins government, it would ensure the country’s COVID-19 vaccination rate goes above 90 per cent, but he is the only leader of a major federal party not to disclose the vaccination status of his own candidates.The NDP and Bloc Québécois both say all of their candidates are vaccinated. The Liberals say all but one of their candidates are vaccinated – the sole exception is someone with a medical exemption.Story continues below advertisement Canadian federal election 2021: Latest updates and essential reading ahead of Sept. 20 vote  Federal election poll tracker: Follow the latest Nanos-Globe-CTV numbers ahead of the Sept. 20 vote  Federal election 2021: What are the challenges facing the major political parties before Canada votes on Sept. 20? The Globe and Mail contacted all Conservative candidates who had publicly listed e-mail addresses and asked the party for the vaccination status of the candidates who did not have public e-mail addresses. The party did not respond to the request.Of the party’s 336 candidates, 49 (15 per cent) said they are fully vaccinated. The remaining did not respond to The Globe.One Conservative candidate said the central campaign had told candidates not to respond to The Globe’s questions. The Globe is not disclosing the person’s name because they were not permitted to discuss internal party matters.At a candidates’ forum for Alberta’s Bow River riding on Tuesday, livestreamed on Facebook by the Brooks & District Chamber of Commerce, Conservative candidate Martin Shields told the audience the party has not asked for his vaccination status.“It isn’t an issue in our party – it’s your choice,” Mr. Shields said. His campaign did not respond to The Globe’s request for comment about his vaccination status.Mr. Shields, who was first elected in 2015, also told the forum that he disagrees with vaccine passports, comparing them to interprovincial trade barriers. “The problem we’ve got already in this country is we’ve got more barriers between our provinces with trade than we do with other countries in the world. This is not another layer for us to add on,” he said.Conservative candidate Scott Aitchison, who is running for re-election in Ontario in the riding of Parry Sound–Muskoka, told The Globe he was glad to get his shots, but said he’s concerned that the issue is being “weaponized” by both the Liberals and the People’s Party of Canada, and criticized the media for doing the same.Story continues below advertisement“I think it’s important for us to be encouraging people to get vaccinated, but the fact that it’s been weaponized the way it has, it’s just ratcheted up the rhetoric and people are getting their backs up,” he said. “I’m double-vaxxed, but I also respect the people that are afraid of it.”A fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic is surging in Canada, and is mostly affecting people who are not vaccinated. The Northwest Territories, Saskatchewan and Alberta are currently experiencing the worst case rates. Premier Jason Kenney this week urged Albertans to get their shots as the province’s health care system struggles to care for people sick with COVID-19 who are filling up hospitals and ICUs.Most provinces are implementing some form of a vaccine passport to access non-essential services and businesses. For most of the pandemic, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau had rejected the idea of mandatory vaccinations, but reversed course just before the federal election. On Aug. 13, the government said travellers on domestic planes, interprovincial trains and cruise ships would need to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The government also said it would make vaccinations mandatory for federal public servants, and it expected the same for federally regulated industries and Crown corporations.Mr. O’Toole rejects that proposal, and says testing should be an alternative for people who don’t want to get vaccinated. That policy stance has been heavily criticized by the Liberals. As more provinces roll out rules for mandatory vaccinations, Mr. O’Toole has repeatedly defended his position on the campaign trail.“I think you should get vaccinated. They’re safe and effective for use,” Mr. O’Toole said on Sept. 12. “We have an ambitious plan to get to 90 per cent [vaccination, by working together. Not by causing division, not by trying to scare people, but by answering questions. And what we need to do is respect that people will make their personal health decisions.”Follow the party leaders and where they stand on the issues this election campaign by signing up for our Morning or Evening Update newsletters.Story continues below advertisementFor subscribers only: Get exclusive political news and analysis by signing up for the Politics Briefing.Build your personal news feedWelcome to The Globe and Mail’s comment community.

      "    permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.comOntario is reporting another 795 COVID-19 cases and five more deaths, according to its latest report released Friday morning.Ontario has administered 35,285 vaccine doses since its last daily update, with 21,318,465 vaccines given in total as of 8 p.m. the previous night.According to the Star’s vaccine tracker, 11,061,902 people in Ontario have received at least one shot. That works out to approximately 84.9 per cent of the eligible population 12 years and older, and the equivalent of 74.4 per cent of the total population, including those not yet eligible for the vaccine.The province says 10,256,563 people have completed their vaccinations, which means they’ve had both doses. That works out to approximately 78.7 per cent of the eligible population 12 years and older, and the equivalent of 69.0 per cent of the total population, including those not yet eligible for the vaccine.The province now includes data that reflects hospitalizations and cases by vaccination status. Ontario warns that the new process may cause discrepancies between other hospitalization numbers being collected using a different process, and that the data may not match daily COVID-19 case counts.The province reports 460 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in unvaccinated people, 53 were partially vaccinated, and 213 cases in fully vaccinated people. Again, the province warns the data may not match daily COVID case counts because records with a missing or invalid health card number can't be linked.The seven-day average is at 724 cases daily, or 34.8 weekly per 100,000. Ontario’s seven-day average for deaths is at 6.7 daily.The province says 33,763 tests were completed the previous day, and a 2.4 per cent positivity rate.There are 336 people currently hospitalized with COVID-19 in the province, including 169 patients in intensive care testing positive for COVID-19. There are 133 people on ventilators, highest reported number since July 10. Locally, Ontario reports 166 new cases in Toronto, 77 in Peel Region, 71 in York Region, 64 in Ottawa and 60 in Durham Region.Meanwhile, the province is reporting that there are no new deaths in long-term care so the number of residents who have died stays the same at 3,807, in the latest report released by the province.Ontario is reporting no new long-term-care homes in outbreak, for a total of seven or 1.1 per cent of LTC homes in the province.This data is self-reported by the long-term care homes to the Ministry of Long-Term Care. Daily case and death figures may not immediately match the numbers posted by the local public health units due to lags in reporting time.There are no new confirmed cases of the Alpha variant first detected in the United Kingdom, for a cumulative total of 146,452 cases.There are no new cases in Ontario of the Beta variant first detected in South Africa, for a cumulative total of 1,502 cases.There are no new cases of the Gamma variant first found in Brazil, for a cumulative total of 5,227 cases.There are 161 more cases of the Delta variant first detected in India, for a cumulative total of 16,086 cases.Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

That is the highest single-day death toll in months.Five of those deaths were in the Interior Health region, four were in Vancouver Coastal Health, and two were in Fraser Health.This comes as the province records another 768 cases,, with Fraser Health recording the most new infections. There were 239 cases confirmed in that health authority, 183 in Interior Health, and 161 in Northern Health.Island Health recorded 102 new infections, while Vancouver Coastal Health saw the fewest, with 83.BC #Covid19 ICU patients by age and vacciation status.#bcpoli @NEWS1130 https://t.co/u8fUHYwx0O— LizaYuzda (@LizaYuzda) September 17, 2021According to the province, about 76 per cent of new cases between Sept. 9 and Sept 15 were among people who had either only had one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or none at all.The number of people in the hospital continues to creep up. There are now 298 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 135 of whom are in the ICU.The health minister says between Sept. 2 and Sept. 15, more than 86 per cent of hospitalizations were due to people who are not fully vaccinated.In the past day, 9,297 British Columbians received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose, meaning 86.5 per cent of eligible British Columbians are at least partly vaccinated.Another 7,462 received their second dose, bringing that percentage to 78.9.On Monday, B.C.’s new vaccine passport came into effect, restricting access to certain settings to only people who can show proof of vaccination against COVID-19. Proof of at least one dose is now required in settings such as restaurants, movie theatres, and gyms.

      "\tAt least eight pregnant Mississippi women have died of COVID-19 since late July -- none of them fully vaccinated -- officials said, more than doubling the state's pandemic total in just two months and spurring medical leaders to give this message:\n",
      "\tWe've long known COVID-19 puts pregnant women at greater risk for severe disease. And with the highly contagious Delta variant spiking case counts, expectant mothers need to know the vaccine is recommended for them.\n",
      "\t\"Please get vaccinated,\" Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the state's medical officer, said at one of two news conferences this month that addressed the topic. \"You've got to protect yourself; you've got to protect your baby.\"\n",
      "\tMississippi's situation likely is not unique, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says COVID-19 deaths in pregnant women in the U.S. appear to have ticked up in August. But health officials in the Magnolia State have been especially vocal about it.\n",
      "\tEight pregnant women died of COVID-19 in Mississippi since July 25, bringing the state's pandemic total to 15, Dobbs said Thursday.\n",
      "\tThe 15 ranged in age from 23 to 40, none was fully vaccinated, and only one was partially vaccinated, Dobbs said.\n",
      "\tAt least 12 of the fetuses survived, often through emergency C-section, and some were severely premature, said Dr. J. Martin Tucker, professor and chair of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. He spoke for the 12 cases that his system was involved with; information about the other three cases wasn't available.\n",
      "\tMississippi also is analyzing information on 72 stillbirths -- deaths of a fetus in the womb after 20 weeks -- that have affected COVID-infected pregnant women in the state since the pandemic began, Dobbs said. That appears to be twice the usual stillbirth rate.\n",
      "\tAll of this has Mississippi health officials pleading with pregnant women to get vaccinated -- and emphasizing that the CDC and others now fully recommend pregnant women to get vaccinated at any stage of pregnancy -- after the highly contagious Delta variant pushed the state's daily case counts to their highest-ever levels this summer.\n",
      "\tAnd the state health department says some shot-givers may not have helped the cause: It received anecdotal reports that some pharmacies declined expectant mothers' requests to get vaccinated, Dobbs said. In response, the health department last week issued a standing order to vaccinate pregnant patients, he said.\n",
      "\tThe order gives the pharmacies reassurance \"that it's OK and recommended for pregnant to get immunized at any stage in pregnancy,\" Dobbs said.\n",
      "\tMississippi still lags the country as a whole in vaccination: 41.7% of the state's population was fully vaccinated as of Thursday, whereas 54.2% of the U.S. population was, according to the CDC.\n",
      "\tOnly about 25.1% of pregnant women age 18 to 49 in the US had received at least one dose of a vaccine during pregnancy as of September 11, according to the CDC.\n",
      "\t\"We can do better than that, and we should do better,\" Tucker said.\n",
      "\tNationally, 155 deaths of pregnant women with confirmed lab evidence of COVID-19 were reported to the CDC from the start of the pandemic through Monday.\n",
      "\tHowever, because only a third of case reports include information on pregnancy status and because it takes jurisdictions two to four weeks to confirm a COVID-19 case in a pregnant woman and report it to the CDC, that number likely is an undercount, CDC spokesman Scott Pauley wrote in an email to CNN.\n",
      "\tThe frequency of these deaths could be ticking up nationally. The CDC received reports of 15 deaths of pregnant people with COVID-19 in August as of last week -- the highest number reported to the agency in a single month, Pauley wrote. The August number could rise as delayed reports come in.\n",
      "\tThe CDC does not break down these deaths by state because of small overall numbers and privacy concerns. It also does not know how many of the 155 were unvaccinated, Pauley wrote.\n",
      "\tPregnant women, compared with nonpregnant women, are more at risk of severe disease from COVID-19 -- and of hospitalization, being placed into intensive care units, being placed on mechanical ventilation, and death, Tucker told CNN in an interview last week.\n",
      "\tTucker also is president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which cites several studies making these points in its advisory to obstetric-gynecologic physicians.\n",
      "\tAs for why, Dobbs pointed in part to changes in pregnant women's physiology and immune responses, and noted other diseases also generally put pregnant women more at risk.\n",
      "\tThe Delta variant may present a more pronounced challenge, in part because of its higher viral loads and increased transmissibility, he said.\n",
      "\t\"We're still early in the analysis of what's going on with Delta, but ... Delta is different, and Delta is deadly, and we have tools to prevent hospitalization and death,\" including immunization for prevention and monoclonal antibodies for treatment, he said.\n",
      "\tThe CDC's Pauley said vaccination for pregnant women is \"more urgent than ever,\" because of \"the increased circulation of the highly contagious Delta variant, the low vaccine uptake among pregnant people, and the increased risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications related to COVID-19 infection among pregnant people.\"\n",
      "\tAs health officials push for pregnant women to get COVID-19 vaccines, they remind them that groups including the CDC last month strengthened the COVID-19 vaccine recommendation for pregnant women.\n",
      "\tThe CDC now outright says that they should get the shots, based on the latest safety data. Previously, the guidance was vague: That pregnant people \"can\" get the vaccine.\n",
      "\t\"COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all people 12 years and older, including people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future,\" the new guidance reads.\n",
      "\t\"Evidence about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy has been growing. These data suggest that the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy,\" the CDC adds in the updated guidance.\n",
      "\tIn late July, the ACOG and another leading organization that represents obstetricians and gynecologists also recommended that anyone who is pregnant should be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n",
      "\tThe ACOG and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine said their recommendations were based on safety evidence from thousands of pregnant women.\n",
      "\tThe CDC said in August that a new analysis of information from its V-SAFE database, used to track vaccine side effects and safety, found no increased risk for miscarriage among people who received either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna coronavirus vaccines before 20 weeks of pregnancy. There were also no safety concerns among people who were vaccinated late in pregnancy -- for themselves or for their babies.\n",
      "\tThe rate of miscarriage among vaccinated pregnant women was about 13%, which is consistent with the rate that would be expected among unvaccinated pregnant women, Sascha Ellington, team lead for emergency preparedness and response in the CDC's Division of Reproductive Health, told CNN on August 11. In response to the myth that the vaccine could cause fertility issues, she said, \"There are no data to indicate that the vaccine has any effect on fertility.\"\n",
      "\tIn a separate analysis, Dr. Elyse Kharbanda of HealthPartners Institute in Minneapolis and colleagues said they looked at different CDC data and also included that COVID-19 vaccines don't raise the risk of miscarriage.\n",
      "\tThey looked at data from eight health systems across the U.S. covering 105,000 pregnancies through June. Those women who suffered miscarriages were no more likely to have been vaccinated, they found. The findings were the same whether women got Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccine, they said in a September letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n",
      "\tToo few pregnant women got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to be able to assess the risk, they said.\n",
      "\tIn Israel, a separate study published this month showed COVID-19 vaccines are just as effective in protecting pregnant women as anyone else.\n",
      "\tIsraeli researchers' study of thousands of pregnant women showed those who were fully vaccinated with Pfizer's vaccine from December 20 to June 3 were 97% protected against symptomatic infection, similar to the rate for the general population at the time, they reported in the journal Nature Medicine. The study did not cover the time after the highly contagious Delta variant became widespread.A pregnant person is seen in this file photo. (Pexels/freestocks.org)\n",

      " 'If you've had COVID — I've had COVID — well then, Mother Nature was creating an immunity' Former Alaskan governor and U.S. vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said she hasn’t been vaccinated for COVID because she’s already had the virus and gained immunity from it.Palin’s revelation came during an appearance on Fox News’ Gutfeld! while guests were discussing CNN anchor Don Lemon. Lemon made a comment to Chris Cuomo on air Wednesday that it was “time to start shaming” unvaccinated people.“It’s too bad he’s going there,” started Palin, who noted that she “personally” liked Lemon, who has been “really nice” to her in the past.“But I am one of those white, common sense, conservatives,” she explained, adding “I believe in science, and I have not taken the shot.”“One, because the waitress never came back to ask me if I’m ready for that shot,” joked Palin. “But two, because I do believe in science and the Fauci-ism-of-the-day back then was, if you’ve had COVID — I’ve had COVID — well then, Mother Nature was creating an immunity.”As Newsweek points out, it’s not entirely clear what advice from Dr. Anthony Fauci that Palin was referring to. Fauci, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, along with a long line of public health experts, have continually encouraged the public to get vaccinated.Palin continued: “even today, you know, you’re 27 percent more immune than…”“Twenty-seven times,” Dr. Drew Pinsky corrected.“Yeah, OK, 27 times,” said Palin. “So I want to ask the questions.”Sarah Palin announces she is unvaccinated pic.twitter.com/yJTsk4dnNCThe figure refers to the findings of an Israeli study of 700,000 people that shows people who’ve had COVID-19 were 27 times less likely to have a symptomatic second case than someone who is vaccinated, although the study has not yet been peer reviewed. Per Newsweek, Fauci told CNN the study doesn’t address how long a natural immune response lasts, raising the possibility that a vaccine could provide longer-lasting protection.According to a CDC study from last month, immunity from COVID vaccination offers 2.3 times the protection of natural immunity. Some people who have had a COVID infection and been immunized against have been found to have ‘super immunity’ to the disease and all variants.In March, Palin shared with People magazine that she had tested positive for COVID-19 and advised people to wear masks, saying she’s proof “anyone can catch this.”“There are more viruses than there are stars in the sky, meaning we’ll never avoid every source of illness or danger,” she said, adding, “but please be vigilant, don’t be frightened,” and “ensure a healthy lifestyle.” Essentials to help you enjoy your ride as the temperatures slide  From scrubs that give back to a pen that just works  We tried it ...
